Ushizaki installs the Hydrus Network and a selection of supporting
programs.

Run with:
dash ushizaki.sh

At this point, you still have to setup the connections between
programs.  For example, you need to activate the Hydrus Network client
API and share the hydownloader API key between hydrus-companion and
the hydownloader-systray.

Suggested Debian GNU/Linux dependencies include:
General dependencies:
git python3 python3-venv
Suggested by the Hydrus Network:
ffmpeg libsqlite3-dev
To compile hydownloader-systray:
cmake g++ make qt6-base-dev
Unsigned extensions are allowed with:
firefox-esr
